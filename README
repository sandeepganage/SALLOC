This is the README file for SALLOC

The code is compiled using CUDA 8.0 for NVIDIA Pascal (GeForce GTX 1080) GPU. GCC version used is 5.3.0.

The source for arena allocator SALLOC is present in the file "salloc_new.h"
There is a driver code named "TESTPROG.cu" which can be used to test the support for push_back() and reserve() operations on vector in the allocator.

The file 'TESTPROG.cu' can be compiled like so:
	nvcc TESTPROG.cu -std=c++11 -o TESTPROG
Further, it should be run with the command: 
	./TESTPROG	


Another code named "cuMalloc.cu" is present in the folder. This file contains code for allocating memory using 'malloc()' function, supported by CUDA 8, from inside the GPU kernel.  The performance of SALLOC is compared with malloc() using this code. 
'cuMalloc.cu' can be compiled like so:
	nvcc cuMalloc.cu -o cuMalloc
 and run with the command: 
	./cuMalloc
 
Currently, arena allocator SALLOC supports the push_back() and reserve() operations on vectors. There is also support for allocating multiple vectors on the arena. 
These vectors can be shared across threads (ie. visible to all threads).
