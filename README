This is the README file for SALLOC

The code is compiled using CUDA 8.0 for NVIDIA Pascal (GeForce GTX 1080) GPU. GCC version used is 5.3.0.

The source for arena allocator SALLOC is present in the file "salloc.h"
There is a driver code named "driver.cu" which can be used to test the operations on the vector in the allocator.

The file 'driver.cu' can be compiled like so:
	nvcc driver.cu -std=c++11 -o driver
Further, it should be run with the command: 
	./driver	


Another code named "cuMalloc.cu" is present in the folder. This file contains code for allocating memory using 'malloc()' function, supported by CUDA 8, from inside the GPU kernel.  The performance of SALLOC is compared with malloc() using this code. 
'cuMalloc.cu' can be compiled like so:
	nvcc cuMalloc.cu -o cuMalloc
 and run with the command: 
	./cuMalloc
 
Currently, arena allocator SALLOC supports the push_back() and reserve() operations on vectors. There is also support for allocating multiple vectors on the arena. 
These vectorsare shared  across threads (ie. visible to all threads).
 allocation of multiple vectors on the arena. 
The vector container supports the following thread-safe operations:
1. push_back()
2. pop_back()
3. getIndex()
4. vecSize()

The details about these are mentioned in SALLOC-description.txt in this folder.
